The *PloneLDAP* product is intended to make it easier to use LDAP
connections in a Plone website. It builds upon the excellent
"LDAPMultiPlugins":http://www.dataflake.org/software/ldapmultiplugins
and 
"LDAPUserFolder":http://www.dataflake.org/software/ldapuserfolder
products which provide the basic LDAP infrastructure. 

The extra functionality provided by this product require features
beyond that are not part of the standard Pluggable Authentication Service.

 * Plone 2.5

 * LDAPUserFolder 2.8

 * LDAPMultiPlugins 1.5
