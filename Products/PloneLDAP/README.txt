The *PloneLDAP* product is intended to make it easier to use LDAP
connections in a Plone website. It builds upon the excellent
"LDAPMultiPlugins":http://www.dataflake.org/software/ldapmultiplugins
and 
"LDAPUserFolder":http://www.dataflake.org/software/ldapuserfolder
products which provide the basic LDAP infrastructure. 

The extra functionality provided by this product require features
beyond that are not part of the standard Pluggable Authentication Service.


Requirements

 * Plone 2.5 or later

 * LDAPUserFolder 2.8

 * LDAPMultiPlugins 1.5

PloneLDAP has been developed for Plone 3.0. While it does support Plone 2.5
it is highly recommended to use Plone 3.0.
